// Step #1
// Model the data that the puzzle is made out of. What data type(s) can you use
// to represent this data? Arrays, strings, booleans, objects, etc.

var name = ['Ellen', 'Heather', 'Rick', 'Walter'],
    lastName = ['Bartley', 'DeForest', 'Fairview', 'Gray'],
    state = ['Ohio', 'Montana', 'Texas', 'Washington'],
    day = ['Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'],
    events = ['anniversary', 'birthday', 'house warming', 'wedding']

// Step #2
// What logical statements can you use to model the six rules of the puzzle?
// Don't worry about whether the variables you use exist or not, just focus
// on the logic of the statements.
